# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
## Project Overview
Customer churn, or attrition occurs when customers cease their relationship with the company by closing accounts or discontinuing the use of its services. 

Predicting customer churn is a critical task for financial institutions. 

In this project, we aim to create a classification model to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not based on various independent variables.

## Objectives
The primary objective is to build an accurate classification model to predict customer churn. 

By doing so, the bank can proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and take measures to retain them, potentially saving the bank from revenue loss and the cost of acquiring new customers.

## Methodology
- Data Collection and Preprocessing - ` Gathering relevant data and cleaning and preprocessing it to handle inconsistencies.`
- Exploratory Data Analysis - `Analyzing the data and summarizing the main characteristics.`
- Data Preprocessing - `Transforming categorical data into numerical form using Label Encoding, feature scaling using Standard Scaling, and handling imbalanaced data using SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique).`
- Machine Learning Algorithms - `Training multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.`
- Model Evaluation Metrics - `Using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.`


## Conclusion
Random Forest achieved the best performance in predicting customer churn. 

The model evaluation resulted in accuracy of 0.8615 and precision of 0.8689.
